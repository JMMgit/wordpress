It is great to see students have fun in learning English by doing different activities in class. I make sure that my students improve their English skills by having active lessons with me. In my free time, I try to learn more about English by watching American shows and movies. I hope you could do the same thing. I can't wait to have lessons with you. Let's see each other in class!</p>
