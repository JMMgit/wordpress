<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<h2>HOW DO I ACTIVATE MY ACCOUNT?</h2>
<p>The instructions to activate your account will be sent to your email once you have submitted the registration form. If you did not receive this email, your email service providerâ€™s mailing software may be blocking it. You can try checking your junk / spam folder or contact us at help@samplestore.com</p>
<h2>CAN I PAY USING PAYPAL WITHOUT A PAYPAL ACCOUNT?</h2>
<p>Yes! It is commonly misunderstood that a Paypal account is needed in order to make payments through Paypal. The truth is you DO NOT need one, although we strongly recommend you sign up to enjoy the added ease of use. </p>
